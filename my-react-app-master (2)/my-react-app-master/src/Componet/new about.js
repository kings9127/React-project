                    <p>Event management is the process of planning and hosting a variety of public and private events for social or business purposes. This can include business conventions, training seminars, industry conferences, trade shows, ceremonies, parties, concerts, festivals, and press conferences.</p>
                    <p>Event managers must follow the clients’ instructions and work within a specified budget and predetermined schedule. They collaborate with various vendors to set up the events. The difference between event management and event planning is that while event planning concerns itself with coming up with workable event ideas and the activities that will take place during the events, event management leans more towards project management and deals with the organization and execution of the event plans.</p>
                    <p>For established and new companies, event management can be an essential aspect of their marketing strategy. Organizing small-scale or large-scale events can help promote a brand and further a business’s interests. Events create opportunities for people who attend these events to learn about the hosting organization’s products and services and may even convert attendees into loyal customers.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, along with making their brands better known, the events that the companies organize can provide marketing education and training to their employees.</p>
